InMoov URDF / Xacro Description File
    Package: inmoov_description


This package provides the description for InMoov.  It also provides all the model information for RViz and Gazebo although the actual launch mechanisms are located in inmoov_rviz and inmoov_gazebo respectively.  Maybe.  Unless I decide to move them to the bringup package.  I might do that now.
