Welcome to InMoov on ROS2
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

ROS is one of the best open source projects for robots that exists with extensive development contributers around the world.  
The aim of this project is to develop ROS2 modules for the InMoov https://inmoov.fr project.  To date, as far as I am aware, there is no working ROS2 modules.
An attempt was made with ROS1 https://github.com/alansrobotlab/inmoov_ros which seems to be abondoned.  I also decided to abandon as ROS2 is clearly the way to move forward.
