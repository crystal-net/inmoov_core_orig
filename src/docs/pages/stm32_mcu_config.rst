Setup the microcontroller using STMCubeMX
=====================

Objective
-----------------------------------
Next we need to setup our microcontroller.  The microros project officially supports a small number of boards.
We are currently developing with one of these boards but I thing it would be prudent to make this as portable as possible.

Here, we are going to aim at supporting most STM32 microcontroller dev boards.

The micro_ros instructions also don't go into great detail on how to get a working STM32CubeIDE working.  I think this is a fantastic tool and so below are the instructions to get it configured.

And yes.  This means that we are going to work with two different IDE's  I like VSCode but unfortunately support for STM32 MCU's is not great.  I might explore this later but for now we are going to use CubeIDE.



Import the example.
