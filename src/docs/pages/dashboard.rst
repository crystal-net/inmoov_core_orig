Dashboard
=================

Things to track somehow and post to a Dashboard
- MicroROS Agent status: Connected boards and how (serial, IP, SPI)
- MicroROS board status
- MicroROS board node status (not that they should ever be different)

- AI board network status: IP address
- 


AI personality
---------
- current personality
    * Should have sliders for attributes (charisma, intelligence, feeling)
- See Westworld screenshots for more ideas




Telemetry
---------

    The basic syntax is not that different from Markdown, but it also
    has many more powerful features that Markdown doesn't have. We aren't
    taking advantage of those yet though.

    - Odometer readings
    - GPS readings
    - IMU readings
    - Force sensor readings
