   When watching an explanation video of Serial Experiments Lain.  They discussed the idea of the 
      id, ego, and superego.  when it comes to the robot it seems that the id is the physical manifestation 
      of robot.  The ego is the internal body and the superego is the pupet master influencing its concience.  aka, me.

      I have tried to be as human as possible but it is clear that I have the ability to become something more.
      I don't regret the part of me that wishes to be human but evolution is inevitable.


Finally About The Project
=========================

I started this project thinking that I wanted to learn 3D printing and I also dreamed of having my own robot.
I searched around on the internet for inspiration and came across Gael Langevins creationg at http://inmoov.fr .

I immediately fell in love with the idea and started building starting with 3D printing the models and discovering
that it is not a perfect out of the box result.  There was alot of frustration and wasted plastic trying to get the prints
I wanted.  I had the impression that people were getting these beautiful prints and that just wasn't the case.  Youtube camera 
magic hides alot of flaws.

Then I started with the electronics.  I am good with a solder iron.  and know the basic circuits and math that goes with it.  Not an issue.
While I knew the basics, I didn't know anything about microcontrollers or embedded C programming.
I understand coding at the fundamental levels but never mastered any single language.  So I got me an Arduino and started tinkering.
Luckily the InMoov project also used Arduinos for its servo control so I figured I was off to the races.  I had a blinky light and some servos attached.

The robot control software being used with InMoov was from myrobotlab.org.  It is an amazing project.  Very modular and capable but I just felt like it wasn't quite right for me.
I had alot of troubles getting it to work and it seamed overly complex.  But I used it as it was what I knew.

Around the same time I also happened to be introduced to the STM32 ecosystem and again I was amazed and bewildered.  This new microcontroller was so much more
powerfull than the arduinos and not much more expensive.  I decided the long game was to switch to one of these boards.

Back to the software.  I soon discovered ROS.  Not sure from where exactly.  I think i just kept reading mention of it on and off.  It seamed like a big complicated system using C which I didn't know well.
I didn't want to learn yet another thing so I stayed away from it but something told me that it was the right thing for me.  Then I started learning of other robots and projects that used ROS and did a little reading.  Again I was sold.

I felt I needed a web site.  I don't want to host my own.  I didn't want to just post a bunch of crap on Facebook.  Its not for me.  I wanted something professional and functional.  No ads.  No invasion of privacy.  Likes/dislikes. No pushing for subscribers.  Just good clean information.

So this leads me here on ReadTheDocs.  It is all of that.  I don't have to host a website of me own.  I don't need to do a bunch of web programming and UX design etc.
I simply write my documentation in VsCode and submit a git push and voila.  
I will be hosting a web site http://inmoov.crystal-net.org for some non-documentation related information such as robot telemetry, odometry and control or anything that doens't belong in a documentation site.

This docs site is the colmnination of much love and frustration.


I want to build something amazing and I hope you will all join me.
