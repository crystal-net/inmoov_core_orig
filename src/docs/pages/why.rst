WHY?
==============



When I  converse with people I meet about why I built this robot or what I plan to do with it.  
I always have a hard time explaining it.  And I guess if I am being honest, my reasons change from day to day.


Some thoughts and ideas:

Why doesn't it look lifelike?
--------------
The primary reason is the wierdness factor.  I think it would be better for it to look more life like, however,
I don't think people are ready for that.  currently it looks alot like one of the robots from the iRobot movie
and most peoples reaction is that it looks amazing.  However when I show them examples of other like Sophie,
their perception changes even though it is largely the same thing.  I think this will change over time but 
today is not that day.  Today is about the movement, stability, durability and AI.


 
Sex bot?
---------------
Of course I always get the typical "are you going to use it as a sex bot?".  While I know this is often in jest,
I also am aware there is a certain amount of intrique and interest in the subject.
I am not going to address that here.  At least not directly.  That is not my intention.


Its turtles all the way down or (movie title)
---------------
The robot should be able to communicate just like humans do, IRL or in VR.
