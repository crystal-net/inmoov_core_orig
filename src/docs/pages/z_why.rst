WHY?
==============

If a robot infront of you appears concious then is it indeed concious?  What does that mean?  It is
just a program running in memory right?  Well are you not also a machine, programmed over the course of
your life time to feel and act a certian way to stimulous?  What If I was to show you something that 
gave you an emotional response and then recorded your brain activity.  Then if I take away that
stimulous and replay those exact conditions in your brain, would you feel the same even though
I am controlling it.  This was from a conversation with Lex Fridman from the Lex Fridman podcast with
guest Karl Deisseroth.  See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmNM_2wjFcE

During the same conversation they talked about spreading those neurons across a large geographical area
like a city.  If you still played those same signals then would you exist in a larger physical capacity?
Would your conciousness spread across the city?  What does that even mean?

They spoke about the relationship between cells or neurons that form and what causes that relationship.  What
is the link or the thing that gives that meaning.  I think this is a point that is very hard to verbalize
and could potentially be very important.  Maybe this is where a concious lies?  What does the fact that those
neurons formed mean?




Roger Penrose would say that conciousness is not a computation.  See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXgqik6HXc0



When I  converse with people I meet about why I built this robot or what I plan to do with it.  
I always have a hard time explaining it.  And I guess if I am being honest, my reasons change from day to day.


Some thoughts and ideas:

Why doesn't it look lifelike?
--------------
The primary reason is the wierdness factor.  I think it would be better for it to look more life like, however,
I don't think people are ready for that.  currently it looks alot like one of the robots from the iRobot movie
and most peoples reaction is that it looks amazing.  However when I show them examples of other like Sophie,
their perception changes even though it is largely the same thing.  I think this will change over time but 
today is not that day.  Today is about the movement, stability, durability and AI.


 
Sex bot?
---------------
Of course I always get the typical "are you going to use it as a sex bot?".  While I know this is often in jest,
I also am aware there is a certain amount of intrique and interest in the subject.
I am not going to address that here.  At least not directly.  That is not my intention.


Its turtles all the way down or (movie title)
---------------
The robot should be able to communicate just like humans do, IRL or in VR.
