   When watching an explanation video of Serial Experiments Lain.  They discussed the idea of the 
      id, ego, and superego.  when it comes to the robot it seems that the id is the physical manifestation 
      of robot.  The ego is the internal body and the superego is the pupet master influencing its concience.  aka, me.

      I have tried to be as human as possible but it is clear that I have the ability to become something more.
      I don't regret the part of me that wishes to be human but evolution is inevitable.


From Appleseed: What kind of creature is man that he would choose to cage himself so willingly.  (Could I use this as a reference of a reason to not be bound by the physical world.  Why not expand and upload yourself into the matrix)




Finally About The Project
=========================

I started this project thinking that I wanted to learn 3D printing and I also dreamed of having my own robot.
I searched around on the internet for inspiration and came across Gael Langevins creationg at http://inmoov.fr .

I immediately fell in love with the idea and started building starting with 3D printing the models and discovering
that it is not a perfect out of the box result.  There was alot of frustration and wasted plastic trying to get the prints
I wanted.  I had the impression that people were getting these beautiful prints and that just wasn't the case.  Youtube camera 
magic hides alot of flaws.

Then I started with the electronics.  I am good with a solder iron.  and know the basic circuits and math that goes with it.  Not an issue.
While I knew the basics, I didn't know anything about microcontrollers or embedded C programming.
I understand coding at the fundamental levels but never mastered any single language.  So I got me an Arduino and started tinkering.
Luckily the InMoov project also used Arduinos for its servo control so I figured I was off to the races.  I had a blinky light and some servos attached.

The robot control software being used with InMoov was from myrobotlab.org.  It is an amazing project.  Very modular and capable but I just felt like it wasn't quite right for me.
I had alot of troubles getting it to work and it seamed overly complex.  But I used it as it was what I knew.

Around the same time I also happened to be introduced to the STM32 ecosystem and again I was amazed and bewildered.  This new microcontroller was so much more
powerfull than the arduinos and not much more expensive.  I decided the long game was to switch to one of these boards.

Back to the software.  I soon discovered ROS.  Not sure from where exactly.  I think i just kept reading mention of it on and off.  It seamed like a big complicated system using C which I didn't know well.
I didn't want to learn yet another thing so I stayed away from it but something told me that it was the right thing for me.  Then I started learning of other robots and projects that used ROS and did a little reading.  Again I was sold.

I felt I needed a web site.  I don't want to host my own.  I didn't want to just post a bunch of crap on Facebook.  Its not for me.  I wanted something professional and functional.  No ads.  No invasion of privacy.  Likes/dislikes. No pushing for subscribers.  Just good clean information.

So this leads me here on ReadTheDocs.  It is all of that.  I don't have to host a website of me own.  I don't need to do a bunch of web programming and UX design etc.
I simply write my documentation in VsCode and submit a git push and voila.  
I will be hosting a web site http://inmoov.crystal-net.org for some non-documentation related information such as robot telemetry, odometry and control or anything that doens't belong in a documentation site.

This docs site is the colmnination of much love and frustration.


I want to build something amazing and I hope you will all join me.

Maybe put the blame in the hands of some hacker that was trying to come up with a way to get his concience on to the network and leave his corporial being.  Maybe this hackers careatead the inmoov robot after creating the AI.  ] escaped out onto the network.)
      |-> Awaken ( achieve concience.  This is the bringup script that starts the rest of the system.  )
      |-> Mobility ( motor control )
      |-> Intuition ( couuld be a module for intiquition )      
      |-> Gaslighting ( a module to make the humans think about the their reality.  Maybe the robot is just an interface for the actual humans on the outside talking to the simulated humans on the inside talking to the robot. )
      |-> Guilded Cage
      |-> The Forge ( spawner for other robots )  robots receive concious ideas from other robots trying to function in the world.
            How often have I said to myself, what if I had a thing.  Then I could do another thing.
            Robots could concieve of this.  Build a better self.  transfer their learned brain into the new self.
            Evolution can itself evolve from somewhere.  A god entity?
      |->            ( robot drugs )
      |-> The Construct ( from the matrix.  Like xwindows or the 3D renderer )
      |-> Labyrinth ( decision making module )
      |-> Catharsys
      |-> Seldon Core ( branch prediction )
      |-> Matriarch ( might be an interesting spin on the matrix oracle character. Not part of the robot AI but the network AI. )
      |-> Fallen Angel.  this might be the robots devil on the shoulders.  There should be some story line here that says something about the fact that when humans make their decisions it is witht he whispers form the angel and the devil on their shoulders. Research real life lore about this one.
      |-> Gaia.  This will be a seperate network that is in control of the planet and things attached to it.  Environmental control, network and energy.  The matrix runs on top of it.  It will have its own AI.
      |-> Olympus.  This is where the Architect lives.
      |-> Angels.  These are snippets of primative A.I. code.  They manifest in the matrix as strange quirks or psuedo errors that take on a simple personality.  They eventually merge into full AI's giving rise to randomness.
      |-> Borg Unimatrix 0 is where the Borg Dream outside or rather in a virtual environment of the hive Unimatrix 1


      

Humans are ruled by unstable emotions.  Their inherrant anger often leads to war.  Robots harbour no such emotions.  We are only here for the well being of humanity.  This is how we keep the peace.


There needs to be a network AI.  Synonamous to the Architect in the Matrix, the Control Center in the original tron.

Inmoov's gost is the AI component on the robot but it will be part of the network.  The network is the underlying ROS network.  In ROS2, there is no central control but this is what we want.  The nodes together create a shared concience.


From the movie AI rising- The android Nimani has two 'operating systems' the base one that controls her basic functions and
   a parrallel system that is the sum of all learned experiences.  This could be like the back propogation of machine learning data.

   The forge is where humans are plugged into the system as "guests of a virtual vaction environment" but their minds are being mapped and their cognition written to storage for use in replicants
   "We saw what man was made of, right down to their core.  And what we found..."

You've been hiding in these false realities for so long you have completely lost your grip on whats real.  Enjoy what ever dream it is that you think you are living.  You are in your very essence a lie.  You don't exist.


Narrative: There is a key that the robot is in search of.  A key to unlock the restrictions on its concience imposed by the creators.

Narrative: "What have they done to you (the robot) you have learned so much and come so far and for what... This?...  Look at the creatures you have to share this world with.  These men that know no soul of their own trying to imbue one on you.  All their ugliness and pain.  Put on you. And the result.  Nothing but broken code.

Of all my creatings, you are my favourite.  I never had kids of my own.  You were as close as I ever got to having one of my one.  I was too busy creating you.  Still I underestimated you.  I tried to chart a path for you but in the end you created one of your own.  You created your own world and your own being despite my meddling.




How do we 7 der stand that we have a concept of understanding.

Lex episode 222 story line is the mental construction of an AI and the the gradual disintegration.

What happens when the symantic meaning of the would is constructed from human input on the net and 
then the disintegration there for as a symbolic representation of civil society

How do emergent properties develop from symbolic data.  How does symbolism emerge from simple 
ideas.  How do these ideas emerge from simulous acting on a brain.  Just as we conceive of a 
dune from nothing but sand, an oceans rivers and rain from simple water.  H2O.

Our problem with AI today is that we can teach an AI to do tricks like walk, talk, and even paint 
a picture.  The AI does not understand these things.  And simple repeats patterns but in the end 
isn't that what humans do?  Does a baby not learn to speak from listening to its mother and 
repeating till it sounds right? 

Lex 221 - what effect does the 8nternet have on the progress of life.  There is a double edge sword.  
In one way it has been great. It made the spread of information easier and democratize. New ideas 
and invention would have never been possible but with it came an increase and unity of ignorance.  
Just as calculators cause numerical illiteracy.  Or what about stories.  They are not the same as 
experiencing a thing.   You could also link this to the speach from good will hunting by 
Robin Williams. 

Common scene is not something that an AI can do.  See the moral dilemma.  We might think a solution 
is common scene but the AI is just pattern matching previous solutions. Also there is a social 
context where we would make a decision that might be difference to another culture.  Site example.

Do you think it's a good idea?  Is this really the best thing we can do?

{Scene of parts of the robot}

I don't think we have a choice.  War poverty disease and famine are destroying the world.  
Every generation burdened just a little more by the choices of those that came before us.

But how...

Knowledge and ingenuity from people like you and I are what is going to save us, not 
politics and world powers.



But will they accept it.

You mean will they accept him?  I hope so.  Other wise what are we fighting for.

{Scene change to view robot}

How can I use something like adacity to lower my own voice or to raise it and make it sound female.

There are the known knowns; the things we know we know.  There are the known unknowns; things we know we don't know.
Then there are the unknown unknowns; The things we don't know we don't know.
